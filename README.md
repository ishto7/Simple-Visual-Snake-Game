# Simple-Visual-Snake-Game
I used to code in C++ sometime. Specialy when I had the course "Fundumentals of programming" in the very first semester of university. This repo was my final project for the course. It has these features:
1. Loading progress bar (for 2 seconds)
2. Three difficulties
3. Optional game ending on hitting the window border
4. Random timed prize every few steps
5. Random walls 
6. Visual!
